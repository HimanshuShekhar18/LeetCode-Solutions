// <--------------------------------------------MONOTONIC DECREASING DEQUE-------------------------------------------------------->
      
//This is generally known as "Monotonic increasing/decreasing  Queue/Dequeue"
//Approach-1 (Using Deque) Every element is added(pushed) and popped only once,
//So it is O(n) time complexity.
//SC: O(n)

/* Algorithm 
1. When new element comes mums[i], make space for it (windom size con't be greater than k)
2. Now, when nums[i] comes, there is no need to keep small elements in thet window, pop then
3. Nom push i in deque >Â» for mas(i)
4. If (i>=k-1), then deq.front() is our onsmer for that window
